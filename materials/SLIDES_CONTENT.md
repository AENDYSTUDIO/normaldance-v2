# NORMAL DANCE — Slide Content (8 slides)

Slide 1 — Title / Vision
- Logo: NORMAL DANCE (Web3 Music Platform Boilerplate)
- Tagline: Build a Web3 Music Platform in Days — Not Weeks
- Subtext: React + Vite + Zustand + Web3 + IPFS + Supabase-ready

Slide 2 — Problem / Opportunity
- Building a modern music dApp is hard:
  - Audio player, playlists, state persistence
  - Web3 wallet, IPFS storage, metadata
  - Production setup (lint/tests/CI, SEO, lazy loading)
- We save 4–6 weeks of engineering time

Slide 3 — Product Screens
- Pages: Feed, Trends, Explore, Library, Upload, NFT, Staking, Statistics, Wallet, Settings
- Player: playlist, repeat/shuffle, persisted state
- Upload: IPFS + fallback, metadata packaging

Slide 4 — Architecture
- Frontend: React 18, Vite, Tailwind
- State: Zustand stores (tracks, player, auth, toasts)
- Web3: ethers (MetaMask)
- Storage: ipfs-http-client (Pinata/mock fallback)
- Backend-ready: Supabase (auth/CRUD scaffold)

Slide 5 — Feature Checklist
- ✅ Persistent audio player with playlist controls
